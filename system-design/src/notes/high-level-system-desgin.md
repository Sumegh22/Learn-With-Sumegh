## High Level System Design: 

### Glossary:

1. Vertical Scaling: 
   * Optimize Processes using same/existing resource -> Here you reconfigure your resource with much better storage and CPU.

2. Preprocessing:
   * Prepare and deploy in cold hours, you might also require a backup, May be master slave architecture

3. Horizontal Scaling :
    * Buying and deploying more machines of similar type to share the load and optimize tasks

4. Microservices Architecture:
    * Distributes concerns and processes as miniature applications, or services
    * Decoupling-systems. 
   
5. Distributed Systems:
    * Ensuring your application/ service has high availability, you need to make it fault-tolerant. 
    * A Distributed System is said to have its presence at more than one location
    * Example could be Dominoz Pizza shop, when you place an order on the app
    * Your order is routed to the closest hub and then it gets delivered to u.

6. Load Balancing:
    * When a user request comes in it reaches a central place, from where it can be rerouted
    * This rerouting tool is load balancer and there has to be a mechanism which ensures request re-routing based on parameters

7. Decoupling of Systems:
    * Distributing services separately to ensure each of them is managed separately
    * Failure of one must not affect others

8. Logging and metrics:
    * To monitor health and metrices of the app
   
9. Extensibility :
